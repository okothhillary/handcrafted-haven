## üõ† Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Reusable Component Pattern
interface ComponentProps {
  children?: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'accent';
}

const ReusableComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  className = '', 
  variant = 'primary' 
}) => {
  const baseStyles = 'transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out';
  const variantStyles = {
    primary: 'bg-amber-700 text-white hover:bg-amber-800',
    secondary: 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300',
    accent: 'bg-yellow-500 text-white hover:bg-yellow-600'
  };

  return (
    <div className={`${baseStyles} ${variantStyles[variant]} ${className}`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Global State Context
interface AppState {
  cart: CartItem[];
  user: User | null;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  ui: UIState;
}

const AppContext = createContext<AppState | null>(null);

export const AppProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(appReducer, initialState);
  
  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### API Integration Layer
```typescript
// Service Layer Architecture
class ProductService {
  private baseURL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;

  async getFeaturedProducts(): Promise<Product[]> {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/products/featured`);
    return response.json();
  }

  async getProductsByCategory(category: string): Promise<Product[]> {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/products?category=${category}`);
    return response.json();
  }

  async searchProducts(query: string, filters: ProductFilters): Promise<SearchResult> {
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
      q: query,
      ...filters
    });
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/products/search?${params}`);
    return response.json();
  }
}
```
